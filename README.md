# Turing-Mach1

A Single Tape Turing Machine Implementation, with transition states definition parser and real time simulation, built using Javascript

## how to write the code

```
init : Q0
final : Qaccept

del : {
  (q1,a,q2,b,>)
}

// write other states as well in the following format

/* currentState, currentSymbol, newState, r/wSymbol, Direction */
```

\*\*\* Based on concepts from the Turing Machine and Recursively Enumerable Language
